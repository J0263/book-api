# Google Books Search Engine with GraphQL

This is a Google Books Search Engine application, refactored to use a GraphQL API with Apollo Server. The application is built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and allows users to search for books using the Google Books API, save books to their account, and view saved books. While the core functionality is in place, some features like login and saving books to user accounts may have limitations and require further refinement.
